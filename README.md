# SSL-and-custom-domains-MAMP
Add SSL and set custom domains for MAMP free version

ðŸš© This example is tested in MAMP 6.3 (Chrome and Safari)
ðŸš© Very important that the MAMP ports are set to 80 & 3306
ðŸš© Change the paths and the testdomain.test to whatever you want

- [ ] In etc/hosts point 127.0.0.1 to testdomain.test

- [ ] Flush the DNS (Ventura) with `sudo dscacheutil -flushcache; sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder`

- [ ] Create a folder in Applications/MAMP named ssl. Also, open a terminal and run `mkcert --install`. If you dont have mkcert, download it with `npm install -g mkcert`.

- [ ] Go to Applications/MAMP/ssl folder you created thru the terminal and run `mkcert testdomain.test`. If you want to force ssl on localhost aswell run `mkcert localhost` aswell. You should now have two .pem-files in the ssl-folder.

- [ ] Open the file Applications/MAMP/conf/apache/httpd.conf and uncomment `#Include /Applications/MAMP/conf/apache/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf`

- [ ] Replace the Applications/MAMP/conf/apache/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf file with the file in this repo. 

- [ ] Now you have connected the created cert with a host. 

- [ ] Restart MAMP and you should be able to enter https://testdomain.test and get a lock in the browser
